        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            As a kid, I was into anything I could get my hands on: instruments, computers, games, books - anything I could interact with and take in. I grew up helping my dad wire and fix various things around the house, learning about transistors and networking, while also inheriting a creative side from my mom. She introduced me to reading and writing: nightly bedtime stories included The Chronicles of Narnia and The Magic Treehouse. I remember playing Halo 3 for the first time on a large CRT T.V. in my basement, which led to an early affinity for video games. I picked up guitar when I was about 9, taking lessons that I loathed, and later stopped to teach myself instead. Now, I put all of this to use in where I intend to be.

            Hazard Lights<br><br>
            "Beauty belongs to all the people. And so long as I am President,<br>
            what has been divinely given to nature will not be taken recklessly away by man."<br>
            President Lyndon B. Johnson,<br>
            on passing the 1965 Highway Beautification Act<br><br>
             
             
            I like to believe that WI-29 was constructed<br>
            for me to escape, <br>
            divine intervention on behalf<br>
            of unspoken, intangible future plans. But<br>
            the WisPave design program has been in use<br>
            since 1972, concrete laid in the spirit<br>
            of American expansion, failing to consider anything else—<br><br>
             
            About 68 miles west of Green Bay, an old man<br>
            wearing a heavy flannel shirt and light blue Levi's<br>
            is looking down at a black, furry mass – unmoving<br>
            save for the wind from passing cars. The hazard lights<br>
            on his white tacoma shower his back<br>
            in blinking golden light; but these are all things<br>
            I'm unsure of—<br>
                                      I dream about you once or twice<br>
            a week these days. In my dreams you slink off<br>
            and make your escape into the farmland<br>
            beyond the road. You evade the truck at the last second,<br>
            a broken concrete mixer strapped<br>
            motionless in the truck bed as he speeds by. <br>
            The man continues driving, never turning<br>
            his head from the road.<br><br>
             
            They call it Bloody 29. Dead animals<br>
            line the side of the road, designated cleanup<br>
            impeded by budget cuts.
